* This year I decided to fulfill my dream, to become a front-end developer. 
I was interested in this direction since my school years, however, by coincidence, 
my real work is not at all connected with this, which does not make me happy. 
That is why I decided to change my job, and therefore I take significant efforts 
to study front-end development. Now I try to devote my maximum free time.
Due to the short development time, I currently have no code samples.
* Currently I have a higher education in law.
* Knowledge of English at the B2 level assessed by the IELTS test.
