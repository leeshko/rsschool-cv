        <h3>About me</h3>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px; text-align: justify; line-height: 25px;">This year I decided to fulfill my
            dream, to become a front-end developer.
            I was interested in this direction since my school years, however, by coincidence,
            my real work is not at all connected with this, which does not make me happy.
            That is why I decided to change my job, and therefore I take significant efforts
            to study front-end development. Now I try to devote my maximum free time.
            Due to the short development time, I currently have no code samples.</p>
